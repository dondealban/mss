\description{
SpatialField: a Class for Spatial Fields (Objects)
}
\details{
A class to store spatial fields, such as temperatures, elevation,
land use, and so on, which have point support (footprint), along with the
domain for which the set observation are valid e.g. to make interpolations.

Fields are representations of continuous phenomena: at every point in continuous
space, a value exists. Observations on fields are, by necessity, discrete and
countable when they refer to points, but may also consist of areas in which case
an infinite number of points with constant value in the area is represented.

SpatialField objects can be generated from points, lines, polygons or grids. For
all classes except points, the attribute values are assumed to be constant and
identical for all points along the line (lines), or over the area (polygons, grids).

The domain of a SpatialField object is the area for which the observations are
considered relevant, e.g. by affording interpolation or aggregation.
}
\note{
If no domain is supplied, the domain is set to the collection of features. A warning is issued if one or more of the features are (completely) outside the domain.
